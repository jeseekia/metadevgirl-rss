                On this blog I will post guides, tutorials, and some of my own learnings around software engineering. I mainly focus on JavaScript, Python, and Java.

                As I build this blog, I am attempting to manage it via my first self-generated RSS feed. A special shoutout to fellow Twitch streamer <a href="https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/how-to-format-dates-for-rss-feeds-rfc-822/" target="_blank">whitep4nth3r</a> 
                for helping me with date formatting in their 2022 article. Apparently I'm not the only one that saw an RSS fee as a viable option.
                <br/>
                I am currently live streaming my #100DaysOfCode journey on <a href="https://youtube.com/@metadevgirl">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://twitch.com/metadevgirl">Twitch</a> where I am transitioning from Software Engineer to Machine Learning Engineer with #100DaysOfML.
                You can find my current and past livestreams as well as other tech advice and videos on YouTube!
                <br/>
